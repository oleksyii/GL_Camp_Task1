*A few rules on how to use a Client/Server application*
1. First run Server and then Client.
2. When Client connects to a Server, enter the name of the application you want to run.
3. When you want to stop an app by sending a command from server - just enter the application's name again. Don't worry about therminal being messed up. It only accepts the letters you've entered.
4. If you want to run an application again, you have to restart both Server and Client

*PLEASE NOTE*
*This Server/Client application uses CMake to compile the files*
